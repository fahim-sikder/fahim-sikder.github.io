In this tutorial, we will learn how to install the latest version of texlive in the ubuntu system! Generally, Ubuntu 20.04 / 18.04 only install Texlive-version-2019 from the local repository! But the Texlive current version is 2021! So, a lot happened in these updates. So, we need to install the 2021 version from the source! But before we do that, we have to uninstall any existing Texlive installation.\nUninstalling existing Texlive Use the following command from the terminal to remove the existing installation of Texlive [3].\n$ sudo apt-get purge texlive* $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/* $ rm -rf ~/.texlive* $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/texmf $ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/texmf $ sudo rm -rf /etc/texmf $ sudo apt-get remove tex-common --purge $ rm -rf ~/.texlive These commands should remove delete any existing texlive installation.\nInstalling Texlive-2021 Now it’s time for install the Texlive latest version! But first, we have to install some dependency [2]!\n$ sudo apt install wget perl-tk We need to get the official installer for Texlive. We can do that by using the following commands:\n$ wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz $ tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz $ cd install-tl-**** Here, **** means the version of the installer! Replace the **** according to your downloaded filename. After changing the directory to the downloaded folder, run the installer by using:\n$ sudo ./install-tl Installation of the latest version of the texlive should start. After the installation, we need to add the installation path with variables to the .bashrc file.\n$ sudo vim ~/.bashrc Add the following variables to the file:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux${PATH:+:${PATH}} export INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/info${INFOPATH:+:${INFOPATH}} export MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/man${MANPATH:+:${MANPATH}} After this, texlive should be installed in the system. We can check it by typing which tex in the terminal. It should return the path where texlive is installed! Now we have to make sure that Ubuntu thinks we have installed texlive. We can do that by installing the equivs package!\n$ sudo apt install equivs --no-install-recommends freeglut3 $ wget -O debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt https://www.tug.org/texlive/files/debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt We are using the debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt file to build a .deb file to install the necessary packages. To build the file and install it follow this:\n$ equivs-build debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt $ sudo dpkg -i texlive-local_2021.99999999-1_all.deb $ sudo apt install -f After this, Texlive should be working just fine in Ubuntu!\nEnjoy!\nCommon Issues in Installation Installing Packages Using Texlive Manager (tlmgr) If we need to install / update packages in our texlive installations, we can use the Texlive manager (tlmgr). We can open the tlmgr by typing the following in the terminal:\n$ sudo tlmgr --gui But sometimes, it can give the error, such as: tlmgr: command not found. If this happens, do the following to open the texlive manager [2]:\n$ sudo env PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH\u0026#34; tlmgr --gui Now, it should work!\nReference  Texlive Official Guide 2021 Post about installing Texlive: Answer Section Post about removing Texlive: Answer Section  ","date":1633076994,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633076994,"objectID":"ea949dcf1a1a7af3b0c5af9351f45dec","permalink":"https://fahim-sikder.github.io/post/installing-texlive-latest-ubuntu/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T10:29:54+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/installing-texlive-latest-ubuntu/","section":"post","summary":"Hello there!

I had to reinstall new libraries, which is doing a new thing repeatedly, and it’s time-consuming. Then I learned about docker. Docker will allow you to create a virtual machine to install all your dependencies for your specific project without tempering your primary system. Still, it is faster than the virtual machine. In this tutorial, we are going to see:\n Installing docker on ubuntu 20.04 LTS Creating and running a python script using docker image  Installing Docker For installing docker from the website for the different OS, you can visit here. First of all, we are going to uninstall previously installed docker (if have any). We will run the following command in the terminal to do that:\n$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc Setting up the Repository Then we need to update the apt packages and install the following dependencies by running the commands:\n$ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install \\ apt-transport-https \\ ca-certificates \\ curl \\ gnupg-agent \\ software-properties-common Now we need to add the Docker’s official GPG key to the system.\n$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - We will use the following command to set up the stable repository.\n$ sudo add-apt-repository \\ \u0026#34;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(lsb_release -cs) \\ stable\u0026#34; Installing Docker Engine To install the docker engine first we have to update the apt package again and run the following commands:\n$ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io Now, the docker should be installed in our system, but before we test it, first we need to add the docker into usergroup, otherwise in some system it will give error. We can do this by using the following commands:\n$ sudo groupadd docker $ sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER} $ grep docker /etc/group $ newgrp docker After running this command, you have to logout or restart the pc. Then run the following command to test the docker system.\n$ sudo docker run hello-world This will download a test container and print some messages and then it will exit.\nCreating First Docker Script Now, it’s time to create our first program that will run on docker. Here we will create a simple script that will measure the square root of a number using the python’s NumPy library. So, in this program, we have a dependency, and that is NumPy. We have to install the dependency inside our docker container. First, we will create a folder containing all the necessary things such as python file, docker image etc.\nThen we will create the python script which we will run, let’s name it main.py and write the following code into that.\nimport numpy as np a = np.sqrt(16) print(f\u0026#39;The square root of 16 is {a}\u0026#39;) Now, let’s create a file name Dockerfile. This file is the blueprint of the docker image. “A docker image is a combination of a file system and parameters.” In other words, this file will contain the information on the working environment, dependencies etc. of our docker app. And the docker container (it’s an instance of docker image) will run the docker system.\nLet’s put the following lines in the Dockerfile.\nFROMpython:3.8ADD main.py .RUN pip install numpyCMD [\u0026#34;python\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main.py\u0026#34;]Now, let’s understand what these lines represent. The docker needs an environment where the docker will run, and this environment can be an operating system, a software package, a python environment etc. Here we are using Python version 3.8 as our environment. By executing FROM python:3.8 line, the docker container pulls python version 3.8 from the docker hub. To add the python script in the docker current directory, we will use ADD main.py . line. The . specifies the current directory. Now, we will be going to install the dependencies, in the python script we have only one dependency, and that is numpy. So to install the NumPy dependency, we are using RUN pip install numpy. If your program has other dependencies, you can add them in this line. And finally, to run the python script, we will use CMD command. Usually, we run a python script in the terminal by using python main.py command. Just like this, we will pass this command into a tokenized list with the CMD command. So, CMD [\u0026#34;python\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main.py\u0026#34;] will run the python script inside the docker container.\nBuilding the Docker Image We have the Dockerfile ready, and we now know what it contains and what the lines inside the Dockerfile does, it is time to build the docker image! To build the docker image, we need to give the following command:\n$ docker build -t first-docker . Here first-docker is our docker image name. We can name it whatever we want. And the -t argument is used for tagging the resulting image. After running this command, it will look like the following screenshot.\n   Running the Docker Image So, our docker image is now ready.

In this post, we are going to see how we can install R in our Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Also, we will install two of R’s popular packages, namely: tidyverse \u0026amp; rstan. Both of these packages are important tools for data scientists. Rstan is the R interface for stan, which is the state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. I faced so much difficulty installing these. So, I decided to make it simple for you guys.\nInstalling R First, let’s install the R in our system. We will install R from CRAN repository. We need to install some dependencies for adding a new repository over HTTPS. To do that, we will run the following command in our terminal.\nsudo apt-get install dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common Then, we need to add the CRAN repository to our system sources’ list. We can do that by typing the following commands into our terminal.\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 sudo add-apt-repository \u0026#39;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/\u0026#39; Finally, we will install R by using the following command.\nsudo apt-get install r-base Now, the R should be installed in our system. To check that, we can run the following command into our terminal.\nR If R is installed correctly, the console will show something like this:\n   Installing tidyverse Now, we will install the tidyverse packages. Please note that we need to install tidyverse first then install rstan, because rstan requires some dependencies. By installing tidyverse first, it will make the job easier. First of all, we need to install some dependencies by typing the following commands in our terminal.\nsudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libv8-dev Then install tidyverse by using the following commands:\nsudo R install.packages(\u0026#39;tidyverse\u0026#39;) It will take some time to get installed. After installation, exit from the r environment using the q() function and be sure to save the environment when prompted.\nInstalling rstan To install the rstan, we need first check if our system has rstan already installed. If it has, then we need to remove it. We can do this by using the following commands:\nremove.packages(\u0026#34;rstan\u0026#34;) if (file.exists(\u0026#34;.RData\u0026#34;)) file.remove(\u0026#34;.RData\u0026#34;) Now, we need to check the c++ toolchain. We can do that by using these commands:\nsudo R pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE) This command will check if the installed c++ is using the pkgbuild package. The system will give the output TRUE if it is using the pkgbuild package. Otherwise, we need to follow instructions from here.\nNow, run the following command to install rstan.\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;rstan\u0026#34;, repos = \u0026#34;https://cloud.r-project.org/\u0026#34;, dependencies = TRUE) Again, it will take some time to get installed. After the installations, exit from the r environment using q() function and be sure to save the environment when prompted.\nHappy Coding!!!\nReferences  Blog post on installing R Official instruction of installing rstan  ","date":1599403151,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599403151,"objectID":"277e075592a1de113171213723425c5e","permalink":"https://fahim-sikder.github.io/post/how-to-install-r-ubuntu-20/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T20:39:11+06:00","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-install-r-ubuntu-20/","section":"post","summary":"This tutorial will show you how to install R in ubuntu 20.04 LTS version and the procedure of installing popular R packages tidyverse and rstan.","tags":["Tutorial","R","rstan","tidyverse","ubuntu","LTS"],"title":"How to Install R and two most popular R packages (tidyverse \u0026 rstan) in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS","type":"post"},{"authors":["Md Fahim Sikder"],"categories":["Tutorial","Julia Tutorial"],"content":"Data Structures In this tutorial, we will see Julia\u0026#39;s data structure. Namely,\n Tuple, Array, Dictionary, and Set  Tuple Lets first discuss about Tuple. Tuple and Array can hold a list of elements. But the basic difference between them is, Tuple is immutable. It means that, we can’t change the value of a tuple once it’s created. We can create a tuple by giving some ordered elements into a paranthesis ( ). The syntax of a tuple is as follows:\n(item1, item2, itme3, ...) Let’s see an example. Suppose we want to create a tuple consists of some mixed values. We just give those values within a paranthesis ( ) or just without the parenthesis. Both will work just fine. Then we can print the type of the tuple by using the typeof() method. To access the elements of a tuple, we can use the index values of tuple, but keep in mind in Julia, index starts from 1. So, in order to access the first element of tuple, we need to follow this syntax:\ntuple_name[1] input tup1 = (1, 2, 4.5, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) println(tup1) #this also works tup2 = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, 11, 0.5, \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; print(tup2) output (1, 2, 4.5, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) (\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, 11, 0.5, \u0026#34;World\u0026#34;)  input println(\u0026#34;Type of tup1: \u0026#34;, typeof(tup1)) println(\u0026#34;Type of tup2: \u0026#34;, typeof(tup2)) output Type of tup1: Tuple{Int64,Int64,Float64,String} Type of tup2: Tuple{Char,Int64,Float64,String}  input #accessing Elements println(tup1[1]) println(tup2[end]) output 1 World  As, we were saying earlier that, tuples are immuatble. That means, we can not change the elements of a tuple after it has been initialized. Let’s test that. We will try to change the third element of tup1. And it will give an error.\ninput tup1[3] = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; output MethodError: no method matching setindex!(::Tuple{Int64,Int64,Float64,String}, ::Char, ::Int64) Stacktrace: [1] top-level scope at In[4]:1  There is an another version of tuples and it is called NamedTuples. Here, we can assign an unique name to each elements of the tuple to access them.\nTo access by using its name we need to use the following syntax:\ntuple_name.variable_name input named_tup = (lang = \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;, int_num = 1, float_num = 3.6) println(\u0026#34;Elements of named_tuple: \u0026#34;, named_tup) println(\u0026#34;Accessing first element by index: \u0026#34;, named_tup[1]) println(\u0026#34;Accessing first element by using variable name: \u0026#34;, named_tup.lang) output Elements of named_tuple: (lang = \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;, int_num = 1, float_num = 3.6) Accessing first element by index: C Accessing first element by using variable name: C  Array Unlike Tuples, Arrays are mutable. So, after assigning values we can change them. We can declare an array in many ways. such as:\narray_name = [item1, item2, ...] array_name = Array([item1, item2, ...]) array_name = Array{DataType}([item1, item2, ...]) Here in the third syntax of declaring array, we can specify what kind of data we want to assign in our array. Lets, create three arrays using these syntax.\ninput arr1 = [1, 2, 3] arr2 = Array([2.5, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, 100]) arr3 = Array{Int64}([4, 6, 8]) println(\u0026#34;Elements of arr1: \u0026#34;, arr1) println(\u0026#34;Elements of arr2: \u0026#34;, arr2) println(\u0026#34;Elements of arr3: \u0026#34;, arr3) output Elements of arr1: [1, 2, 3] Elements of arr2: Any[2.5, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, 100] Elements of arr3: [4, 6, 8]  These are the example of 1 dimensional array. The syntax of declaring 2 dimensional array is follows:\narray_2d = [item1 item2; item3 item4; ...] Let’s create an array which has 3 row and 2 columns or an (3*2) array.\ninput arr_2d =[1 2; 3 4; 5 6] arr_2d output 3×2 Array{Int64,2}: 1 2 3 4 5 6  Array Operations To insert, delete or sort elements of an array we can use some built in methods like insert(), deleteat(), push(), pushfirst(), pop(), popfirst(), sort(). Let’s use these methods. To insert elements in an array we can use push(), pushfirst() and insert() methods. push() method insert an element in the end of the array, pushfirst() inserts an item at the begining of the array, and insert() method insert an item into a given location. The syntax of insert() method is\ninsert(arr_name, position_to_insert, value) Let’s first insert into an array.\ninput test_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] push!(test_arr, 100) println(\u0026#34;Array after using push method: \u0026#34;, test_arr) pushfirst!(test_arr, 12) println(\u0026#34;Array after using pushfirst method: \u0026#34;, test_arr) insert!(test_arr, 3, 2525) println(\u0026#34;Array after using insert method: \u0026#34;, test_arr) output Array after using push method: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100] Array after using pushfirst method: [12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100] Array after using insert method: [12, 1, 2525, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]  To delete elements in an array, we can use pop(), popfirst() and deleteat() methods. pop() method deletes an element from the end of the array, popfirst() deletes an item from the begining of the array, and deleteat() method deletes an item from a given location.

It was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM. To install it we need to download it’s binary from here. We are going to use Jupyter Notebook as the code editor. But to do that we need to link the Jupyter Notebook with Julia. After installing Julia, open the Julia Command prompt with administration rights. Then type the following code:\nusing Pkg Pkg.add(\u0026#34;IJulia\u0026#34;) These will integrate Julia environment with Jupyter Notebbok.\nN.B: We are assuming that your system has already Jupyter notebook installed.\nJulia file has .jl extensions. It’s time to write our first program. We will print Hello Julia!. The print function in julia is println.\ninput println(\u0026#34;Hello Julia!\u0026#34;) output Hello Julia!  Congratulations! We have just run your first program in Julia.\nVariables \u0026amp; Data Types Julia support 5 basic data types.\n Integer Float String Character Boolean  We can easily declare a variable just assigining the value in it. We don’t need to give the datatype when declaring a variable. Also we can see what is the datatype of a variable by using typeof function. Lets see an example.\ninput first = 1 println(typeof(first)) second = 22.0 println(typeof(second)) third = true println(typeof(third)) fourth = \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; println(typeof(fourth)) fifth = \u0026#39;L\u0026#39; println(typeof(fifth)) output Int64 Float64 Bool String Char  String needs to be in double quotes or triple quotes. If we put String in single quote, it will show error. Only Character will be in single quote.\ninput #This is an intenional error strr = \u0026#39;Hello world\u0026#39; println(strr) output syntax: invalid character literal  Constant To declare a constant we need to use const keyword. After defining a constant we can redefine it, but it will give us a warning. We only can redefine in the same datatype. Suppose: we created a constant with integer datatype with a value, so we can redefine it with another integer value though it will give a warning, but we can not redefine with another datatype. It will give an error.\ninput const var1 = 2 println(var1) var1 = 3 println(var1) #this will give error var1 = 4.9 println(var1) output 2 3 WARNING: redefining constant var1 invalid redefinition of constant var1 Stacktrace: [1] top-level scope at In[4]:5  Strings As we have mentioned earlier, String needs to be in double or triple quotes.\nmystr = \u0026#34;Hey this is a string\u0026#34; mystr2 = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; this is a multiple line string this string has 2 lines \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; We can see the length of a string using the length function.\ninput mystr = \u0026#34;Hey this is a string\u0026#34; println(length(mystr)) output 20  Taking seperate characters from string We can access seperate characters from the string using index. Here we need to keep in mind that, unlike other programming language, Julia access its first character from a string using index 1. Suppose in mystr we want access the first character H , so we need to access it using mystr[1]. Now, if we want to access the last character of a string we need to use the end keyword. So, in mystr the last character is g and we can access it by using mystr[end].\ninput println(mystr[1]) println(mystr[end]) output H g  Substring We also can get a substring from a string by slicing it. To do that we need to use : this. Suppose we want this as substring from mystr string. So, this started from index number 5 and ended in index number 8. Then we need to access it using mystr[5:8].\ninput println(mystr[5:8]) output this  String Concatenation To concatenate one string with another we need to use * keyword. Suppose we have two strings. str1 = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; and str2 = \u0026#34;World\u0026#34;. We can merge them like this:\ninput str1 = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; str2 = \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; println(str1 * \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; * str2) output Hello, World  Thats it for this tutorial.\nGood Luck, and May the Julia be with you!\n Other posts in this series:\n Julia Tutorial Part 2: Data Structures  ","date":1594196640,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594196640,"objectID":"cb722aef6386e09dd8747bdedadf3e87","permalink":"https://fahim-sikder.github.io/post/julia-tutorial-part-1/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T14:24:00+06:00","relpermalink":"/post/julia-tutorial-part-1/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction, Installations, and Basics Julia is a open source programming language.
